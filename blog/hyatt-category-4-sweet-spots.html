                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">TL;DR — Why Hyatt Category 4 Still Slaps in 2026</h2>
                <ul class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 text-base text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>Hyatt preserved a 15k standard cap</strong> while Marriott and Hilton went dynamic — meaning you still have a ceiling to anchor value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Category 1-4 free night certificates</strong> from the World of Hyatt Credit Card, Bilt Rent Day, and Sweet Elite Milestones can routinely unlock $500–$900 cash stays.</li>
                    <li><strong>Daily housekeeping, resort fees waived, and 2pm late checkouts</strong> (Globalist) still apply when you book through points or RoomPoints discovery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transferable currencies love Hyatt</strong> — Chase Ultimate Rewards and Bilt Rewards still convert 1:1, making these sweet spots easy to hit even if you’ve never held a Hyatt card.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>The Search Methodology We Used</h2>
                <p>RoomPoints ingests live Hyatt availability across 5,000+ properties. For this guide we filtered every Category 4 hotel that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Showed repeatable 15,000-point “Standard” availability in the last 60 days.</li>
                    <li>Carried an average cash price above $420 after taxes.</li>
                    <li>Had at least one desirable differentiator — suite-style rooms bookable as standards, unbeatable location, waived resort fees, or elite-benefit stacking.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>We then grouped winners into use-cases (city breaks, nature escapes, business trips, and aspirational suites) so you can match them to your upcoming calendar instead of hoarding certs past expiration.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Hyatt Category 4 Rules (2026 Refresh)</h2>
                <p>If you’re new to the Category 4 conversation, here’s what changed — and what didn’t — this year:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Standard room awards remain 12k/15k/18k</strong> for off-peak/standard/peak. Hyatt announced no devaluation for 2026, so budgeting 15k per night still works if your dates are flexible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Certificates ignore peak pricing.</strong> Drop a Cat 1-4 free night certificate on peak nights and still pay zero points, provided the property hasn’t moved to Category 5.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fifth-night-free? Not here.</strong> That’s a Marriott + Hilton perk. Instead, Hyatt gives you <em>Guest of Honor</em> bookings (elite perks share), Milestone rewards, and confirmed suite upgrades. Pairing a certificate night with those benefits is how you beat the system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cash + Points (6k points + 50% cash)</strong> can also sneak under the Category 4 ceiling when standard awards are gone but inventory still exists.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Top Category 4 Sweet Spots by Region</h2>
                <p>Below you’ll find our 2026 all-stars. Each property includes real world pricing snapshots pulled directly from RoomPoints members.</p>

                <h3 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold">1. North America City Breaks</h3>
                <p>Perfect for maximizing long weekends, elite qualifying nights, or stacking with companion airfare deals.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Thompson Austin (Texas, USA)</strong> — routinely $520+ with taxes, but bookable for 15k points. Use it for Formula 1, South by Southwest, or ACL Fest when cash prices surge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hyatt Regency Vancouver (BC, Canada)</strong> — $480 CAD summer rates plus 15% tax. RoomPoints alert data shows 17 nights of 15k availability in June/July 2026.</li>
                    <li><strong>Andaz Ottawa ByWard Market (Ontario, Canada)</strong> — A boutique stay with rooftop views of Parliament. Cash nights are $430 CAD; certificates cover even Canada Day.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Why it works:</em> Hyatt still treats premium downtown locations as Category 4 if the room count is high. Business-heavy hotels like Austin’s Thompson collapse on weekends, making award space plentiful.</p>
                <img src="placeholder-rooftop-bar.jpg" alt="Rooftop bar at Thompson Austin" class="w-full rounded-2xl shadow-lg my-8">

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">2. Mexico & Caribbean Resorts</h3>
                <p>Hyatt quietly added boutique all-inclusives, but the legacy Cat 4s remain unstoppable for families.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hyatt Zilara/Ziva Cancun (Adults / Families)</strong> — When they drop to Category 4 in off-peak months, you’re getting $680 rooms plus all-inclusive dining for a single certificate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Andaz Mayakoba Resort (Playa del Carmen)</strong> — Technically toggles between Category 4 and 5, but 20+ nights each September still load at 15k points.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hyatt Regency Grand Reserve Puerto Rico</strong> — Massive suites, waived resort fees, and a golf course view that sells for $550 cash.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Transfer Chase points instantly once RoomPoints pings availability. These resorts vanish within hours because free breakfast + no resort fees is unheard of in Cancun.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Europe Culture Hubs</h3>
                <p>Hyatt’s European footprint is still smaller than Marriott’s, but the quality per point is higher.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hyatt Centric Milan Centrale</strong> — Next to Milano Centrale with rooftop aperitivo lounge. Cash rates hit €480 during Fashion Week; certificates ignore the surge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile</strong> — Technically Category 5, but watch for extended maintenance windows when it temporarily prices as Category 4. RoomPoints flagged three multi-day windows in January 2026.</li>
                    <li><strong>Story Hotel Riddargatan, part of JdV (Stockholm)</strong> — Design-forward boutique that rarely shows points availability publicly. RoomPoints surfaces hidden inventory at 15k in shoulder season.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">4. Asia-Pacific Luxury for Pennies</h3>
                <p>Asia remains the easiest region to crush CPM (cents per point) valuations because cash rates stay high but Hyatt refuses to reclassify.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur</strong> — $360 cash weekdays, $220 weekends, but club lounge access + skyline infinity pool make it a $600 experience. Certificates clear almost every month.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hyatt Regency Kyoto</strong> — Base rooms include 600 sq ft tatami suites that sell for ¥68,000. Book during cherry blossom season for unmatched value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alila Manggis (Bali)</strong> — Beachfront eco-luxury, typically 8k–12k points, but still eligible for Category 4 cert top-off nights. Stacks perfectly with Bilt Rent Day bonuses.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">5. Business Travel Power Plays</h3>
                <p>Sometimes you just need a dependable property that keeps expenses low but still impresses clients.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hyatt Place London City East</strong> — Trendy co-working vibe, breakfast included, and $410 cash rates midweek. Use certificates to pad elite nights while cutting T&E budgets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hyatt Regency Seattle</strong> — Convention center adjacent, 1,260 rooms, and 15k awards even during AWS re:Invent overflow weeks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hyatt Centric South Beach Miami</strong> — Rooftop pool + gym partnership with Exhale. Weekend rates push $580; certificates book a “SUNSET KING” with partial ocean view.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>New for 2026: Hidden Suites and Guest of Honor Loopholes</h2>
                <p>Hyatt quietly rolled out two updates, both of which tilt in your favor:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Standard Suite Awards Reclassified.</strong> Select properties now list junior suites as “Standard.” If a Category 4 hotel does this, your 15k redemption drops into a 650 sq ft suite without needing a Globalist upgrade.</li>
                    <li><strong>Guest of Honor via Bilt.</strong> Rent Day status matches now allow non-Globalists to gift Guest of Honor bookings on certificate stays. That means guaranteed free breakfast + late checkout for your parents without you being on the trip.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Combine those with RoomPoints’ alert engine and you have a rinse-and-repeat playbook for group travel.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Chase Ultimate Rewards → Hyatt: Transfer Tactics</h2>
                <p>Chase remains the easiest way to build Hyatt balances. Here’s how we’re coaching members to prep for Category 4 strikes:</p>
                <h3>1. Stack Quarterly Category Bonuses</h3>
                <p>Freedom Flex’s rotating categories regularly include gas, PayPal, and grocery stores. Pair those with a 5x multiplier, then immediately sweep points to your Sapphire Reserve. We’ve seen members generate 30,000 UR per quarter without touching sign-up bonuses.</p>
                <h3>2. Use Pay Yourself Back as a Bridge</h3>
                <p>Not ready to transfer yet? Erase travel at 1.25¢ via the Reserve to keep your balance liquid, then retransact when Hyatt space opens. You avoid losing value to a surprise devaluation but still maintain optionality.</p>
                <h3>3. Execute a Same-Day Transfer on Alerts</h3>
                <p>RoomPoints alerts include a one-click “Transfer to Hyatt” instruction (with estimated hold times). Because Chase → Hyatt transfers are instant, you can go from SMS ping to confirmed Park Hyatt Kyoto booking in under 10 minutes.</p>

                <h2>How RoomPoints Surfaces Cat 4 Space Before Anyone Else</h2>
                <p>You can absolutely grind Hyatt’s website manually, but here’s why most of our members let automations do the work:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hotel Graph Enrichment:</strong> We track 12 months of price history per property and highlight “anomalies” when cash rates spike but award space doesn’t close.</li>
                    <li><strong>Certificate Clock:</strong> Plug in your cert expiration dates, and RoomPoints will sort suggestions by urgency. No more panic bookings the night before they die.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transfer Readiness:</strong> Connect your Chase, Amex, Bilt, and Citi accounts (read-only). When a Hyatt alert hits, we show exact balances, suggested transfer combos, and tax-optimized strategies.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI Concierge:</strong> Paste your trip idea (“July wedding in Puerto Rico”). We’ll return a curated list of Category 4-eligible hotels, total points required, and projected CPM.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>That stack means your “search” time drops from hours to seconds — leaving more time to, you know, actually travel.</p>

                <h2>FAQ: Rapid-Fire Answers for 2026</h2>
                <div class="space-y-6">
                    <div>
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Did any fan-favorite properties move up to Category 5 this year?</h3>
                        <p>Yes: Park Hyatt Siem Reap and Hyatt Centric Waikiki both jumped. If you’ve been hoarding certificates, pivot to the remaining list above ASAP.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Can I stack a Category 4 certificate with a Milestone Suite Upgrade?</h3>
                        <p>Absolutely. Certificates simply replace the points component of the stay; suite upgrades attach to your reservation number regardless of payment type.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">What about all-inclusive properties?</h3>
                        <p>Hyatt Zilara/Ziva resorts are capacity-controlled and often bucketed at Category 4 outside school holidays. The catch is that Hyatt sometimes restricts certificate usage to minimum three-night stays. Watch the fine print.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>Only when you have a specific booking in mind. Hyatt points are stable, but any devaluation risk should be matched with immediate usage.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Is there still value in buying Hyatt points?</h3>
                        <p>When Hyatt runs a 25% bonus sale, you’re effectively paying ~1.92¢ per point. That’s still a win for properties delivering $500 nights at 15k points (3.3¢). Anything below 2.1¢ remains a green light in our tracker.</p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>Hyatt Category 4 remains the most generous mid-tier sweet spot in the entire hotel universe. Certificates still grant outsized value, inventory continues to open in predictable windows, and transferable currencies keep fueling the engine. If you’re organized — or if you let RoomPoints automate the organization for you — you can easily clear $3,000+ in luxury stays each year without touching your cash account.</p>
                <p>So go set those alerts, mark your certificate expirations, and line up a few long weekends. The luxury suite you screenshot on Instagram is waiting at 15,000 points.</p>
